        <br> rounded corners - With the CSS border-radius property(first value applies to top-left corner, second value applies to top-right corner, third value applies to bottom-right corner, and fourth value applies to bottom-left corner), one can give any element "rounded corners".
        <br> attribute selectors - The CSS Attribute Selector is used to select an element with some specific attribute or attribute value. It is an excellent way to style the HTML elements by grouping them based on some specific attributes and the attribute selector will select those elements with similar attributes.
       <br> css3 selectors - CSS3 introduces some new selectors. Using these selectors one can choose DOM elements based on their attributes. So he/she don't need to specify classes and IDs for every element. Instead, they can utilize the attribute field to style them.
       <br> css3 web fonts - CSS3 also facilitates embedding any custom font on a webpage. Fonts are dependent on the client system and Web pages can render only fonts that are supported by the browser or the client machine. By using the @font-face property, one can include the font from a remote location and can then use it.</p>
